<h1> <br> Introduction to JavaScript </h1> <br> TIME  2016-11-29 06:30:00 <br> Chicago 222 W. Ontario Street, Suite 450 <br> <p>In this workshop you will learn about the basics of the JavaScript programming language. This course is designed for beginners with little to no experience in programming. </p> <p>Why learn JavaScript?<br/>Most popular websites out there run on JavaScript for their front-end. e.g. Facebook, Yahoo, Google, Instagram, Pinterest, Reddit, etc…</p> <p>Most languages can be replaced with another language. For instance, you can replace Java to C++ and Python to Ruby, but it is near impossible to replace JavaScript. It is not only used on the client side (Angular.js or React.js), but it is also used on the server side (Node.js).</p> <p>What you will learn: </p> <p>• Arithmetic Operations <br/>• Variables<br/>• Strings<br/>• Methods/Functions Please have the following installed:</p> <p>• Web Browser (preferably Chrome or Firefox)</p> <p>By end of the workshop, you should be well prepared for our intermediate level JavaScript workshop.</p> <p>See you there!<br/>- CT</p> <p><a href="http://www.codingtemple.com">www.codingtemple.com</a> Follow us on Facebook!<br/><a href="https://www.facebook.com/codingtemple" class="linkified">https://www.facebook.com/codingtemple</a></p> <br> <br>

<h1> <br> Nine Neins - Where Java EE will never take you. </h1> <br> TIME  2016-12-01 06:30:00 <br> Chicago 100 North Riverside <br> <p>Markus Eisele</p> <p>With Microservices taking the software industry by storm, classical Enterprises are forced to re-think what they’ve been doing for almost a decade. It’s not the first time that technology shocked the well-oiled machine to its core. We’ve seen software design paradigms changing over time and also project management methodologies evolving. </p> <p>Old hands might see this as another wave that will gently find it’s way to the shore of daily business. But this time it looks like  the influence is bigger than anything we’ve seen before. And the interesting part is, that microservices aren’t new from the core.</p> <p>Talking about compartmentalization and introducing modules belongs to the core skills of architects. Our industry also learned about how to couple services and build them around organizational capabilities.</p> <p>The really new part in microservices based architectures is the way how truly independent services are distributed and connected back together. Building an individual service is easy with all technologies. Building a system out of many is the real challenge because it introduces us to the problem space of distributed systems.</p> <p>And the difference to classical, centralized infrastructures couldn’t be bigger. There are very little concepts from the old world which still fit into a modern architecture.</p> <p>And there are more differences between Java EE and distributed and reactive systems. For example, APIs are inherently synchronous, so most Java EE app servers have to scale by adding thread pools as so many things are blocking on I/O (remote JDBC calls, JTA calls, JNDI look ups, even JMS has a lot of synchronous parts). As we know adding thread pools doesn't get you too far in terms of scalability.</p> <p>This talk is going to explore the nine most important differences between classical middleware and distributed, reactive microservices architectures and explains in which cases the distributed approach takes you, where Java EE never would.</p> <p>

About Markus Eisele:</p> <p>Markus Eisele is a Java Champion, former Java EE Expert Group member, deputy lead of the Java community of German DOAG, founder of JavaLand, reputed speaker at Java conferences around the world, and a very well known figure in the Enterprise Java world. He works for Lightbend. </p> <p>You’ve known and seen him at different conferences and Java User Groups meetups or read his blogs or are following his social media presence. While talking about middleware for many years you’ll continue to hear him talk about enterprise grade Java going forward. Focussed on education about the latest trends in building enterprise systems in a reactive way with Java. </p> <p>He’s been looking into containers and microservices architectures more deeply and also wrote a book about modern Java EE Design Patterns with O’Reilly. He is excited to educate more about how microservices architectures can integrate and complement existing platforms, and will also talk about how to successfully build resilient applications with Java.</p> <p>AGENDA</p> <p>5:30-6 - Beer/Food/Networking</p> <p>6-7 - Nine Neins - Where Java EE will never take you</p> <p>7-8 - Beer/Gaming (We can set up halo and such)</p> <br> <br>

Lets discuss how to use Griddle and how to switch things around to translate our basic grid into something more feature-rich.</p> <p>Ryan Lanciaux is a professional software developer in Ann Arbor, MI. Although he programs in several languages, his current area of focus is front-end development. Ryan attempts to contribute to the development community through his (often neglected) blog.</p> <br> <br>
<h1> <br> Table XI Apprenticeship </h1> <br> TIME  2016-12-01 07:00:00 <br> Chicago 320 W Ohio St 5th floor <br> <p>Join us at Trunk Club to learn about the apprenticeship program at Table XI! Table XI is a Chicago digital design and development consulting firm where Ethan Kent and Zino Hu began working as apprentices. We'll hear a talk from Ethan about his experiences, followed by Q&amp;A with Ethan and Zino. We'll have food and drinks too!</p> <p>More about Ethan Kent:<br/>I spent almost five years practicing law in Chicago, but found the work unsatisfying. I have long been interested in technology and began teaching myself to code several years ago as a hobby. I decided last fall to make a career change, and picked up the intensity and focus in my self-study program. I began applying for positions in the spring, and started with Table XI as an Apprentice in August. I am much happier in my new career, and look forward to discussing my path with other aspiring developers.</p> <p>More about Zino Hu:<br/>I'm a back-end developer, building applications mostly in Ruby/RoR. I use RSpec and practice TDD, at least for most of the time :) Most of my code is on Github, though a lot of it is private. Besides Ruby, I also have some experience with Java, Javascript, and K. I used to work at a columnar database company. So I know a few things about databases.</p> <br> <br>

<h1> <br> Python Office Hours at Pumping Station: One </h1> <br> TIME  2016-12-01 08:00:00 <br> Chicago 3519 N. Elston Ave. <br> <p>This is a chance for people of all experiences levels to get together for programming, socializing, and moral support while working on things.</p> <p>Take a look at the event <a href="https://wiki.pumpingstationone.org/Python_Office_Hours">wiki</a> for more details.</p> <p>This is a flipped "office hours" where you can learn from your peers.</p> <p>In flipped classrooms students watch lectures and read material outside the classroom then work on things in person. This isn't a formal class, but the idea is similar. Many people who attend are there to help.</p> <p>If you prefer to work on things on your own, that is okay too! If someone asks for help, let them know that you are working on something and not available for help at the moment.</p> <p>We talk on irc during office hours at #pyoo on freenode. It is handy for sharing links to information and pastebins. If you don't have an irc client, you can connect to the channel via this web client: <a href="https://kiwiirc.com/client/irc.freenode.net/?nick=pyoo%7C?#pyoo">#pyoo</a></p> <p>If you don't already have something to work on or study, check out the wiki page for ideas.</p> <br> <br>
